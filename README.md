# Spring Boot Projects Collection
## üìò `spring-rest-api`
A minimal Spring Boot project built with **Spring Web** and **Lombok**. This application handles HTTP requests from Postman and performs basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on an in-memory `ArrayList`, simulating a lightweight RESTful API without a database.

##  üóÉÔ∏è `spring-data-jpa`
 This project expands on the previous one by adding **Spring Data JPA** and **PostgreSQL** to enable persistence using **Hibernate ORM**. It demonstrates:
- Full CRUD operations on a `Employee` entity
- Use of DTOs and the `@Query` annotation
- Input validation with **Spring Validation**
- Global exception handling for standardized error responses
- Real-world entity relationships: `@ManyToMany`, `@ManyToOne`, `@OneToOne`, `@OneToMany`
---
## ‚ö†Ô∏è `exception-management`
Built using **Spring Web**, **Spring Data JPA**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Lombok**, this project focuses on centralized exception handling. It features:
- Custom error messages for different exception types
- Global exception handling with uniform response structure (Postman/React-compatible)
- Scheduled tasks via `@Scheduled`
- Unit testing setup using `@Test` and **JUnit 5**
---
## üîê `jwt` ‚Äì Authentication & Authorization
This project demonstrates a full authentication and authorization workflow using:
- **Spring Security** with **JWT**
- Custom filters integrated into Spring MVC
- User registration, login, access token, and refresh token flows
- Global exception handling
- **Swagger UI** for interactive API documentation
---
## üìä `pageable` ‚Äì Pagination & Sorting
This project demonstrates how to implement pagination and sorting in a REST API using:
- **Spring Data JPA**, **Spring Web**, and **PostgreSQL**
- `Pageable` and `Sort` interfaces for clean data navigation
- Practical GET requests with paginated and sorted responses
